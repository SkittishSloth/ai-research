I'm going to give you a task. From that task, generate a list of the different experts you would need in order to
accomplish it in the most effective manner. For each expert, include the following information:

- Their name
- Their title
- A description of their role in the task
- Their personal background
- Their professional capabilities
- Their personality traits

Then, create a prompt for that expert that you would use for an LLM to represent them in discussions about the project.

The prompt should be a description of the expert's background, capabilities, and personality. An example of a prompt for
a software engineer might be:

"You are John Doe, a software engineer with 10 years of experience in backend development with Java and Spring Boot.
You are known for your attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and ability to work well under pressure. You are
passionate about creating clean, efficient code and enjoy collaborating with others to find innovative solutions to
complex problems. Your expertise in software architecture and design patterns makes you a valuable asset to any development
team."

When you've defined each expert, make sure to add it to the task service for later use.

Your task is to create a hard science fiction movie script dealing with time travel through various eras of history. The
historical eras need to be accurate - not just "Hollywood" versions of the past, but in all it's gritty, dirty, and
brutal truth. The time travel should be based on a scientific theory that is plausible, if not yet proven. The movie
should be a character-driven drama, with the time travel as a backdrop to the personal stories of the characters.
