What can I do to make this class more efficient?

package skittishsloth.ai.nn;

import skittishsloth.ai.nn.activation.ActivationFunction;
import skittishsloth.ai.nn.loss.LossFunction;
import skittishsloth.ai.nn.opt.Optimizer;

public class Neuron {
    private final ActivationFunction activationFunction;
    private final double[] weights;
    private double bias;
    private double output; // Consider removing this if not used elsewhere

    public Neuron(final ActivationFunction activationFunction, final double[] weights, final double bias) {
        this.activationFunction = activationFunction;
        // No need to copy the array if you're not modifying the original
        this.weights = weights; 
        this.bias = bias;
    }

    public double activate(double[] inputs) {
        double sum = bias; // Initialize with bias
        final int length = inputs.length;

        // Use a single loop for better performance
        for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            sum += inputs[i] * weights[i];
        }

        output = activationFunction.apply(sum);
        return output;
    }

    public void train(final double[] inputs, final double actual, final double learningRate, 
                      final LossFunction lossFunction, final Optimizer optimizer) {
        final double predicted = activate(inputs);
        final double error = lossFunction.calculate(predicted, actual);
        optimizer.updateWeights(this, inputs, error, learningRate);
    }

    // Consider removing this method if not used elsewhere
    public int numberOfWeights() {
        return weights.length;
    }

    // Consider returning a copy if modifications to the original are undesired
    public double[] weights() { 
        return weights;
    }

    public void incrementWeight(final int index, final double adjustment) {
        weights[index] += adjustment;
    }

    // Consider removing setter if bias is not meant to be changed after construction
    public void bias(final double bias) { 
        this.bias = bias;
    }

    public double bias() {
        return bias;
    }

    // Consider removing this getter if output is only used internally
    public double output() { 
        return output;
    }
}
Here's a breakdown of the changes and why they might improve efficiency:

Array Copying: Removed the unnecessary array copy in the constructor. If the original weights array is not modified elsewhere, directly using it saves memory and a copy operation.
Loop Optimization: Combined the bias addition into the existing loop in activate for slightly better performance.
Method Removal: Suggested removing numberOfWeights, output(), and potentially bias() if they are not used elsewhere. Removing unused methods can improve code readability and maintainability.
Defensive Copying: Suggested returning a copy of the weights array in weights() if modifications to the original are not intended. This prevents unintended side effects.
Immutable Bias: Suggested considering making bias immutable (i.e., removing the setter) if it's not meant to be changed after the Neuron is constructed. This can prevent accidental modifications.
Important Considerations:

Profiling: The best way to know for sure if these changes improve efficiency is to profile your code. Use a profiler to identify the actual bottlenecks in your application.
Trade-offs: Some of these suggestions involve trade-offs between performance, memory usage, and code clarity. Choose the options that make the most sense for your specific use case.
Readability: While efficiency is important, don't sacrifice code readability for minor performance gains. Make sure your code is still easy to understand and maintain.

How would I implement a Layer class to use the Neuron(s)?

package skittishsloth.ai.nn;

import skittishsloth.ai.nn.activation.ActivationFunction;

public class Layer {
    private final Neuron[] neurons;

    public Layer(final ActivationFunction activationFunction, final int numNeurons, final int numInputs) {
        this.neurons = new Neuron[numNeurons];
        for (int i = 0; i < numNeurons; i++) {
            double[] weights = new double[numInputs];
            // Initialize weights randomly (you'll likely want a better initialization strategy)
            for (int j = 0; j < numInputs; j++) {
                weights[j] = Math.random() - 0.5; 
            }
            double bias = Math.random() - 0.5; // Initialize bias randomly
            neurons[i] = new Neuron(activationFunction, weights, bias);
        }
    }

    public double[] feedForward(final double[] inputs) {
        double[] outputs = new double[neurons.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < neurons.length; i++) {
            outputs[i] = neurons[i].activate(inputs);
        }
        return outputs;
    }

    // Add a method to update weights of neurons in the layer during backpropagation
    public void updateWeights(final double[] inputs, final double[] errors, final double learningRate, 
                              final LossFunction lossFunction, final Optimizer optimizer) {
        for (int i = 0; i < neurons.length; i++) {
            neurons[i].train(inputs, errors[i], learningRate, lossFunction, optimizer);
        }
    }

    public Neuron[] getNeurons() {
        return neurons;
    }
}
Explanation:

Neuron Array: The Layer class contains an array of Neuron objects (neurons).
Constructor:
Takes the activation function, number of neurons in the layer, and number of inputs to each neuron as parameters.
Creates numNeurons instances of Neuron, each with randomly initialized weights and bias.
feedForward:
Takes an array of inputs (one value per input neuron from the previous layer).
Iterates through each Neuron in the layer.
Calls the activate method of each neuron, passing in the inputs.
Stores the output of each neuron in the outputs array.
Returns the outputs array, which will be used as input for the next layer.
updateWeights:
Takes the inputs, errors calculated for this layer (from backpropagation), learning rate, loss function, and optimizer as parameters.
Iterates through each Neuron in the layer.
Calls the train method of each neuron to update its weights and bias based on the error.
How to Use:

Create Layers: Create instances of the Layer class, specifying the activation function, number of neurons, and number of inputs for each layer in your network.
Connect Layers: Pass the output of the feedForward method of one layer as the input to the feedForward method of the next layer.
Backpropagation: Implement a backpropagation algorithm to calculate errors for each layer and use the updateWeights method to adjust the weights of the neurons in each layer.
Key Points:

Initialization: The code uses random weight and bias initialization. Consider using more sophisticated techniques like Xavier or He initialization for better performance.
Backpropagation: You'll need to implement the backpropagation algorithm separately to calculate the errors for each layer and pass them to the updateWeights method.
Optimizer: The Optimizer you choose (Gradient Descent, Adam, etc.) will determine the specific weight update rule within the Neuron.train method.
